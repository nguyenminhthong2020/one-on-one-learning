I am an outgoing person and I have this passion for dealing with different people and seeing them progress with my help as their teacher. In fact, making friends is one of my best skills. I am very good at adapting to new environments and new situations. I am very friendly and can easily get along well with everyone.\n\nI have obtained a 120-Hour TEFL Certificate.
