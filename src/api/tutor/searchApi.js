In my class, I will help you correct your pronunciation and deliver the lessons in a way that is easy for you to understand.\nIf you book my class, you will have many chances to practice your speaking skills and also improve your pronunciation and grammatical knowledge.\nBesides that, if you need me to, I will share my personal tips to study English more effectively with you and show you the importance of having fun and practice while learning English."
